# Python Min Project

This project primarily serves to gather various small projects that I have accumulated during my daily study of Python.


| Project                                                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Project 1 - American Flag](https://github.com/sunyufei92/Python-Min-Project/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20American%20Flag) | This project demonstrates how to use Python's **turtle** graphics module to draw the American flag. The flag is composed of 13 horizontal stripes, alternating red and white, and a blue rectangle in the top left corner containing 50 white stars arranged in a grid pattern. This project is a great way to practice using turtle graphics and understanding basic programming concepts in Python. |
| [Project 2 - Peppa Pig](https://github.com/sunyufei92/Python-Min-Project/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Peppa%20Pig) | This project demonstrates how to use Python's **turtle** graphics module to draw a representation of Peppa Pig, the beloved children's cartoon character. The drawing includes detailed components such as the nose, head, ears, eyes, cheeks, and mouth, each created using various turtle graphics techniques. This project is an excellent exercise for those looking to improve their skills with turtle graphics, practice function-based programming, and explore creative uses of loops and shapes in Python. |
| [Project 3 - Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/sunyufei92/Python-Min-Project/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20Tic%20Tac%20Toe) | This project implements a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid as either 'X' or 'O'. The game ends when one player successfully marks three consecutive spaces in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the grid is filled without a winner (resulting in a tie). This project is great for beginners who want to practice Python basics, including control flow, user input, and working with data structures such as dictionaries. |
