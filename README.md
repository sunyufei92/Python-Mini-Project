# Python Min Project

This project primarily serves to gather various small projects that I have accumulated during my daily study of Python.


| Course                           | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| [Linear Algebra with Python](https://github.com/your-link) | This training will walk you through all the must-know concepts that set the foundation of data science or advanced quantitative skill sets. Suitable for statisticians, econometricians, quantitative analysts, data scientists, etc. to quickly refresh linear algebra with the assistance of Python computation and visualization. Core concepts covered are: linear combination, vector space, linear transformation, eigenvalues and -vector, diagonalization, singular value decomposition, etc. |
| [Basic Statistics with Python](https://github.com/your-link) | These notes aim to refresh the essential concepts of frequentist statistics, such as descriptive statistics, parameter estimations, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, etc. All codes are straightforward to understand. We spent roughly three hours in total to cover all sections. |
| [Econometrics with Python](https://github.com/your-link) | This is a crash course for reviewing the most important concepts and techniques of econometrics. The theories are presented lightly without complex mathematical derivation, and Python codes are mostly procedural and straightforward. Core concepts covered: multi-linear regression, logistic model, dummy variable, simultaneous equations model, panel model, and time series. |
