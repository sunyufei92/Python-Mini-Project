# Python Min Project

This project primarily serves to gather various small projects that I have accumulated during my daily study of Python.


| Project                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| [Project 1 - American Flag](https://github.com/sunyufei92/Python-Min-Project/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20American%20Flag) | This project demonstrates how to use Python's turtle graphics module to draw the American flag. The flag is composed of 13 horizontal stripes, alternating red and white, and a blue rectangle in the top left corner containing 50 white stars arranged in a grid pattern. This project is a great way to practice using turtle graphics and understanding basic programming concepts in Python. |
